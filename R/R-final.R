##############
 

dfmerge %>% filter(is.na(StudentId) == F )%>%
  group_by(DepartmentName) %>%summarise(Studentnum = n_distinct(StudentId))%>% filter(is.na(DepartmentName) == F )




##############
## Q2. How many students have each course of the English department and the 
##     total number of students in the department?
##############

dfmerge %>%  filter(DepartmentId == 1 ) %>%
  group_by(CourseName) %>%summarise(Studentnum = n()) 
print("the total number of students in English department is")
